    <h1>Philip Ruke</h1>
        <p><em>Junior Web Developer in Training</em></p>
        <p>I am a self-taught web developer that has been taking online courses to learn how to code and create pretty and practical web sites. I also enjoy video games, music, coffee, and growing culinary mushrooms! &#127918; &#127926; &#9749; &#127812;</p>

    <h3>Books and Teaching</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I got started with CodeCademy early on, after attending Purdue University for a B.S. in General Managegment in 2015/2016, which I used their basic entry to web development there. I created three exceptionally basic websites that I used for personal tasks and achiement tracking (I don't unfortunately have the code anymore for these sites and they are long since taken down).</li>
            <li>I restarted my web development dreams in late 2019, early 2020 when I lost interest in getting my CCNA (I received my CCENT in 2016) and felt that IT was too static for me and I needed something I could <strong>create</strong> with.</li>
            <li>In early 2020 I used SkillShare and took Kaleb Taulien's courses on front end web development to help re-initiate me.</li>
            <li>In late 2020 after finishing most of his course I decided to jump ship to Angela Yu's Complete Web Development Bootcamp, on Udemy. Her course helped immensely to fit my learning style needs and actually got my career up and running.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>I spend much of my free time playing video games by myself or with friends. Some of my favorite games are <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/character/6315207/">Fantasy XIV</a>, Dead by Daylight, the Resident Evil series, and the Silent Hill series.</li>
            <li>When I'm not gaming, I'm usually relaxing on my patio with a bonfire going, cooking something good to eat, or longboarding with my wife!</li>
            <li>My other notable interest is in cultivating culinary mushrooms. I really enjoy growing harvests of shiitake and oyster mushrooms! I've always been interested in fungi since I was little, so while I never became a mycologist, I have at least made it a fun hobby and interest.</li>
